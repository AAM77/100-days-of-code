# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Committed to the challenge. Set up a GitHub repo for tracking. Set a specific goal with a basic plan. Wrote a blog post about it. Found a course on Udemy that also includes quizzes, challenges, and major projects that I can work on to upload to GitHub.

**Thoughts:** It's a little intimidating putting myself out there, but I work best under a little pressure.
