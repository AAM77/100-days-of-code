# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Mohammad Adeel]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.

Started on [Monday, February 4, 2019].

## Legend:
**R1 stands for Round 1.**
Each round consists of 100 days. Once I finish 100 days, I might want to do it again. That will be round 2.

**D stands for Day.**
So, D0 & D1 would be  Day 0 & Day 1. of the round. It goes up to D100, or Day 100.


## Log


### R1D0: February 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Committed to the challenge. Set up a GitHub repo for tracking. Set a specific goal with a basic plan. Wrote a blog post about it. Found a course on Udemy that also includes quizzes, challenges, and major projects that I can work on to upload to GitHub.

**Thoughts:** It's a little intimidating putting myself out there, but I work best under a little pressure.

### R1D1: February 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
Got through 16 of 110 lectures of the course.
Did some practice exercises to familiarize myself with the concepts.

**Thoughts:**
I wanted to practice with real challenges, but I need to familiarize myself until I cover all of the fundamentals. So, begrudgingly forgiving myself for not practicing real challenges until I get through the fundamentals.

### R1D2: February 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
Got through five more lectures. Now on lecture 22 of 110 course lectures. Coded along and completed exercises and quizzes to test my knowledge. Practiced several examples on my own as well.

**Thoughts:**
I completed fewer lessons than yesterday, so I'm a little bummed about that. In all fairness, though, these lessons were longer and I kept stopping to practice the material.

### R1D3: February 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
Completed six more lectures today. On 29 of 110 now. learned about tuples, which I hadn't encountered before. Also learned about file input and output using Python. Cool stuff : ). Spent time practicing the concepts on my own.

**Thoughts:**
Getting there. Getting there. I need to keep reminding myself that I'm still making progress no matter how slow it might seem.

### R1D4: February 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
Made it through seven lectures today. On 36 of 110 now. Reviewed the previous material and took a self-assessment test. Then, learned how control flow & loops (for & while) work in Python.

**Thoughts:**
Finally getting to the fun stuff! I might be able to make start working on challenges soon! Can't wait. : )

### R1D5: February 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
Only two lectures today, but they were packed. On 38/110 now. Learned about range, enumerate, and zip. Also learned how to accept user input, import libraries, and how to use 'in', min, & max. Oh, and list comprehensions. Decided to spend the time practicing these before moving on.

**Thoughts:**
Phew! Lots of new stuff! I'm going to have to spend more time practicing this tonight so I can take the assessment test tomorrow!

### R1D9: February 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
- In project mode, so still on lesson 56/110
- Didn't get much done for Tic-Tac-Toe (finalizing plan)
- Attended a data structure coding challenge study group (was great!)

**Thoughts:**
I wish I had gotten more project stuff done. But, I'm sooo tired. I should sleep.

### R1D10: February 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
- Added some functions to the tic-tac-toe project:
- greet, print logo, print board
- asks user input for X or O, asks user input for position
- assigned player 1 and player 2 based on input
- update function for board
- tested in isolation to make sure each function works as intended
- completed coding challenges

**Thoughts:**
I got a decent bit done in just a couple of hours. Not bad.

### R1D11: February 15, 2019
**Today's Progress**:
- Got home late, so not much done
- Added more functions to the tic-tac-toe project:
- tracks if current player is 'X' or 'O'
- tracks turns taken
- laid out a plan for the next few functions I need to add

- tested functions

**Thoughts:**
Sigh. I wish I could have gotten more done. Well, something is better than nothing.

### R1D12: February 16, 2019
**Today's Progress**:
- Woke up and made good progress on tic-tac-toe
- Got it sort of working.
- I refactored it, though. Need to test out the refactored code.

**Thoughts:**
I think I made good progress, but I was in a rush to get some coding in today, so I forgot to make regular commits and test code. smh. Trying to sort it all out afterwards is going to take up more time than it would have if I had just gone step-by-step. Sigh. Learning form my mistake and move forward.
