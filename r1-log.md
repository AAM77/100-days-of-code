# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Mohammad Adeel]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge.

Started on [Monday, February 4, 2019].

## Legend:
**R1 stands for Round 1.**
Each round consists of 100 days. Once I finish 100 days, I might want to do it again. That will be round 2.

**D stands for Day.**
So, D0 & D1 would be  Day 0 & Day 1. of the round. It goes up to D100, or Day 100.

### R1D0: February 4, 2019


**Today's Progress**: Committed to the challenge. Set up a GitHub repo for tracking. Set a specific goal with a basic plan. Wrote a blog post about it.

**Thoughts:** It's a little intimidating putting myself out there, but I work best under a little pressure.
